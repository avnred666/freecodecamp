   <h4>The Beginnings(1878-1945)</h4>
   <p>Manchester United was formed in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR Football Club by the Carriage and Wagon department of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR) depot at Newton Heath.The team initially played games against other departments and railway companies, but on 20 November 1880, they competed in their first recorded match; wearing the colours of the railway company – green and gold.</p>
   <br>
   <h4>The Busby Years(1945-1969)</h4>
   <p>Post World War-2, in October 1945, the impending resumption of football led to the managerial appointment of Matt Busby, who demanded an unprecedented level of control over team selection, player transfers and training sessions.Busby led the team to second-place league finishes in 1947, 1948 and 1949, and to FA Cup victory in 1948. In 1952, the club won the First Division, its first league title for 41 years.With an average age of 22, the back-to-back title winning side of 1956 were labelled "the Busby Babes" by the media, a testament to Busby's faith in his youth players.In 1957, Manchester United became the first English team to compete in the European Cup.The following season, on the way home from a European Cup quarter-final victory against Red Star Belgrade, the aircraft carrying the Manchester United players, officials and journalists crashed while attempting to take off after refuelling in Munich, Germany. The Munich air disaster of 6 February 1958 claimed 23 lives, including those of eight players – Geoff Bent, Roger Byrne, Eddie Colman, Duncan Edwards, Mark Jones, David Pegg, Tommy Taylor and Billy Whelan – and injured several more. Busby rebuilt the team through the 1960s by signing players such as Denis Law and Pat Crerand, who combined with the next generation of youth players – including George Best – to win the FA Cup in 1963. The following season, they finished second in the league, then won the title in 1965 and 1967. In 1968, Manchester United became the first English (and second British) club to win the European Cup, beating Benfica 4–1 in the final.</p>
   <br>
   <h4>The Wilderness Years(1969-1986)</h4>
   <p>Following Matt Busby's departure, the club endured some torrid times during which they won only two FA cups and no league title with the nadir coming in 1974 when it was relegated to second division</p>
   <br>
   <h4>The Ferguson Years(1986-2013)</h4>
   <p>Ferguson was appointed manager of Manchester United in November 1986. During his 26 years with Manchester United he won 38 trophies, including 13 Premier League titles, five FA Cups and two UEFA Champions League titles. He was knighted in the 1999 Queen's Birthday Honours list, for his services to the game. Ferguson is the longest serving manager of Manchester United, having overtaken Sir Matt Busby's record on 19 December 2010. He retired from management at the end of the 2012–13 season, having won the Premier League in his final season. The period also saw the rise of Manchester United to a global brand with millions of followers world wide. It also saw the club being floated in the stock market and its subsequent purchase by the Glazer family.</p>
   <br>
   <h4>Post Ferguson Era(2013-present)</h4>
   <br>
   <p>Sir Alex was succeeded by the then-Everton manager David Moyes. Following a poor season, he was sacked and Louis Van Gaal took over. Van Gaal led the club to its first silverware after Sir Alex by winning the FA cup in 2016. However, poor league showing and inability to finish in the top 4 saw him being sacked. Jose Mourinho took over as the manager for the 2016-17 season, which is in progress.</p>
